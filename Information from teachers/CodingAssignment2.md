# IF.03.01 Basic Web Technique

## Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice all concepts of html and css we have done so far.

Another goal is to make you dig deep into your project topic. You shall extend the content of your project overview such that for each section there a whole page of information shall be available.

## Materials
If you work under macOS you will be already very familiar with the environment using

- Atom
- Chrome or Safari
- GitHub.

If you are working on a Windows machine then you need an alternative editor. Atom is available also on Windows. Furthermore you can use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.html). Working with GitHub and Chrome is basically the same as under macOS.

Furthermore you may require your cheat sheets you have prepared so far or you consult the links in the prior ReadingAssignments in case you get in troubles with html/css issues.

Finally it might be possible to use Photoshop or a similar software to adapt images to your web site. Please take care that this is not a design course so the creation of stunning images is not part of the course. Rather we use images to try to convey our basic ideas.

## Required Tasks
1. Review your project overview page from coding assignment 1.
   - Does it contain all topics you want to cover?
   - Is there anything to be changed or added after reflecting the review by your English teacher?
   - Adapt your overview accordingly
2. Create a separate html page for every section and copy the content of the project overview into the pages
3. Extend the content with more information, images, tables, whatever necessary to get a nice report on your topic.
4. Make a pleasant and proper design of your pages.
4. Design a stunning and attractive main page for your site.
5. Consider a pleasant and proper navigation for your pages to put them together into a coherent web site.
2. Validate your Html code.
3. Check your Html code whether it is properly formatted. Take care of proper indentation

## Hints
- Try to get your content up to a good amount quickly. Without content styling makes no sense, so the earlier you have a significant amount of content the better. Keep your English teacher up to date concerning this and also do not hesitate to ask there.
- Since you for sure will have more than one file to submit for this coding assignment it is required to start off and maintain some project structure:
   - Create a separate folder reflecting the name of your project in the repository. Please give it a useful name. If you work on the project, e.g., on the project *Communication - now and then* the folder name `project` is not appropriate, `communication` would be fine, as `CommunicationNowAndThen` would be.
   - Create sub folders for different file types (html, css, images, ...).
   - Only the main html file is on the top level of your project folder.

## Things to Learn
- Html
- Css
- Bootstrap
- Structuring a small sized web site
- Building navigation for a small sized web site

## Evaluation
All coding assignments will get checked. Most common reasons that your assignment is marked down are:

- Project's Html pages do not validate
- One or more items in the *Required Tasks* section are not satisfied
- Submitted code is visually sloppy and hard to read
- Content is not sufficient to evaluate whether the technical implementations are sufficient.

Finally check the [Rubrics](Rubrics.md) (Units 1 to 5 and "All" at the end of the table) to remember which criteria we use when checking your code.

## Extra Credit
1. Make at least one of the pages with [parallax scrolling](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp)
2. Make one page using the css grid. Css grid is a powerful tool to separate a page into different sections and facilitates layout using css heavily. Check out [this tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) for this task.
