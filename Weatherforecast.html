        <h3>Antiquity</h3>
        <h4>3000 BC </h4>
        <p>In India meteorology can be tracked back to this date with writings such as the "Upanishads",
        containing discussions about the processes of cloud formation and rain and the seasonal cycles caused by the movement of earth round the sun.</p>
        <h4>600 BC </h4>
        <p>Thales, the first greek meteorologist reputedly issues the first seasonal crop forecast. </p>
        <h4>400 BC </h4>
        <p>Hippocrates writes a treatise called Airs, Waters and Places, in which he writes about common diseases that occur in particular locations and seasons. </p>
        <h4>350 BC </h4>
        <p>The Greek philosopher Aristotle writes Meteorology, a work which represents the sum of knowledge of the time about earth sciences,
        including weather and climate. It is the first known work that attempts to treat a broad range of meteorological topics
        For the first time, precipitation and the clouds from which precipitation falls are called meteors,
        which originate from the Greek word meteoros, meaning 'high in the sky'. From that word comes the modern term meteorology,
        the study of clouds and weather.
        Although the term meteorology is used today to describe a subdiscipline of the atmospheric sciences,
        Aristotle's work is more general. Meteorologica is based on intuition and simple observation
        but not on what is now considered the scientific method. In his own words: </p>
        <q>...all the affections we may call common to air and water, and the kinds and parts of the earth and the affections of its parts.</q>
        <p>The magazine De Mundo notes:</p>
        <blockquote>Cloud is a vaporous mass, concentrated and producing water.
        Rain is produced from the compression of a closely condensed cloud, varying according to the pressure exerted on the cloud;
        when the pressure is slight it scatters gentle drops;
        when it is great it produces a more violent fall, and we call this a shower, being heavier than ordinary rain, and forming continuous masses of water falling over earth.
        Snow is produced by the breaking up of condensed clouds, the cleavage taking place before the change into water;
        it is the process of cleavage which causes its resemblance to foam and its intense whiteness,
        while the cause of its coldness is the congelation of the moisture in it before it is dispersed or rarefied.
        When snow is violent and falls heavily we call it a blizzard.
        Hail is produced when snow becomes densified and acquires impetus for a swifter fall from its close mass;
        the weight becomes greater and the fall more violent in proportion to the size of the broken fragments of cloud.
        Such then are the phenomena which occur as the result of moist exhalation.</blockquote>
